           <h2>The process</h2>
           <p>Our brand experts receive ongoing training in identifying counterfeits. This is our finest commitment to our community of vintage lovers. Our brand experts check every detail of each item that we receive before it is uploaded to our site. The verification process include a detailed evaluation of a combination of elements, such as the hallmarks, label, hardware, stitching, zippers, buttons, metal parts, symmetry, material, craftsmanship, stamping, codes and hologram stickers.
           </p>
           <p>Furthermore our brand experts carefully evaluate the workmanship of every item and the materials to ensure that every item that we sell is 100% consistent with the original item description and the established standards of the brand in question. If the item has been modified or repaired (replaced leather parts, metal parts, stitching etc.), this will always be mentioned in the product description.
           </p>
           <p>After the authentication process, the item is photographed and uploaded to our site – ready to find a new lovely owner. When the item is sold, it is wrapped in silk paper, packaged and shipped immediately to the new happy owner. You don’t like what you have received? No problem – the order is cancelled; and the purchase is refunded in full.
